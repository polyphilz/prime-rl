"""HF<->prime weight conversion for GLM-4 MoE, as a declarative op chain.

GLM-4 MoE specifics:

* Router: HF ``mlp.gate.weight`` -> prime ``mlp.router.gate.weight``.
* Expert bias: HF ``mlp.gate.e_score_correction_bias`` -> prime
  ``mlp.router.selection_bias``.
* Routed experts: HF per-expert ``mlp.experts.{e}.{gate,down,up}_proj.weight``
  stack into prime ``mlp.experts.{gate,down,up}_proj`` along dim 0; the fused
  transformers-v5 ``mlp.experts.gate_up_proj`` / ``down_proj`` layout is also
  accepted on the way in (split along dim 1).
* Shared experts: HF ``mlp.shared_experts.{gate,down,up}_proj.weight`` map to
  prime ``mlp.shared_expert.{gate,down,up}_proj.weight``. On the way back to HF,
  GLM strips a leading singleton dim from each shared-expert tensor when present
  (:class:`~prime_rl.trainer.models.conversion_ops.SqueezeLeading`,
  backward-only).
* Prime-only runtime buffer ``mlp.tokens_per_expert`` is dropped on the way
  back to HF.

The per-layer MoE op builder (:func:`glm_moe_layer_ops`) is shared verbatim
with GLM-MoE-DSA, whose attention/MLA weights pass through untouched.
