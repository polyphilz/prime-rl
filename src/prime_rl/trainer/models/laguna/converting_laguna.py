"""HF<->prime weight conversion for Laguna, as a declarative op chain.

Laguna specifics:

* Router: HF ``mlp.gate.weight`` maps to prime ``mlp.router.gate.weight``.
* Expert bias: the HF input is *either* ``mlp.experts.e_score_correction_bias``
  *or* ``mlp.gate.e_score_correction_bias`` (the former wins when both are
  present); it maps to prime ``mlp.router.selection_bias``. Backward always emits the
  canonical ``mlp.experts.e_score_correction_bias``.
* Routed experts: HF per-expert ``mlp.experts.{e}.{gate,down,up}_proj.weight``
  *or* the fused ``mlp.experts.gate_up_proj`` / ``down_proj`` layout stack into
  prime ``mlp.experts.{gate,down,up}_proj``.
* Shared expert: the HF input is *either* ``mlp.shared_expert.*`` *or*
  ``mlp.shared_experts.*`` (singular wins); it maps to prime
  ``mlp.shared_expert.{gate,down,up}_proj.weight``.
  Backward always emits the singular ``mlp.shared_expert.*``.
* Prime-only ``mlp.tokens_per_expert`` is dropped on the way back to HF.
