[DeepSeek V4 Attention Layers]

The attention layers in this architecture generally begin with a few sliding-window attention layers
(just the first two layers in V4 Flash) followed by interleaved complex compressed attention
variants involving either Compressed Sparse Attention (CSA) or Heavily Compressed Attention (HCA).
CSA compresses with a smaller window (~4 toks) and adds additional sparsity on top via a "Lightning
Indexer", while HCA uses a more aggressive window (~128 toks) with no additional sparsity. A sketch
of the compressed variants is below, tensors flowing downwards:

[Packing Details]

We describe our abstractions and nomenclature for DeepSeek V4 packed sequences below, which are
useful due to the complexities introduced by the compressed attention variants. Ultimately, all
necessary attention data is organized into a `PackedContext` object (directly consumed by attention
layers), built from one `seq_lens` and carrying:

  - `attention_mask`: causal, local-window, clipped at document boundaries.
  - `position_ids`: each token's position within its own document.
  - `tok_doc_idx`: which document each token belongs to.
  - `position_embeddings`: the RoPE tables, one per rope type, evaluated at `position_ids`.
  - `compression_layouts`: one `CompressionLayout` per compress rate in the architecture.

The last of those characterizes the token-compression mechanism of DeepSeek V4. We start with it
below.

We pack several documents end to end in a flat token stream. Each compressed attention variant
defines a `compress_rate`: that variant compresses each group of `compress_rate` consecutive tokens
into an individual `entry`. For packed sequence and each `compress_rate` in the architecture, we
build one `CompressionLayout` object whose responsibility is to handle the document-aware bookkeeping
for such packed-document compression.

Take the following illustrative example of two packed documents and `compress_rate = 4`:

  token             0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 │   9 10 11 12 13
                  └───────── doc 0 ─────────┘   └─── doc 1 ───┘
  entry           └─── e0 ───┘└─── e1 ───┘  x   └─── e2 ───┘  x

We've indicated which tokens get pooled into which entries (tokens marked `x` belong to no entry) .
A complete, generic description of the packed and compressed state requires four pieces of data:

  - Which tokens belong to which entries: `entry_tok_idx`.
  - Which document each entry belongs to (for causality): `entry_doc_idx`.
  - Where an entry sits within its own document (useful for RoPE + causality): `entry_local_idx`.
  - Which document each token belongs to (causality, again): `tok_doc_idx`.

For the above example:

  token             0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 │   9 10 11 12 13
                  └───────── doc 0 ─────────┘   └─── doc 1 ───┘
  entry           └─── e0 ───┘└─── e1 ───┘  x   └─── e2 ───┘  x

  entry_tok_idx    [0  1  2  3][4  5  6  7]      [9 10 11 12]
  entry_doc_idx        0           0                 1
  entry_local_idx      0           1                 0
  tok_doc_idx       0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0     1  1  1  1  1

The first three depend on the compress rate and are stored on the `CompressionLayout` abstraction
used below. The fourth does not: `tok_doc_idx` describes the token stream alone, so `PackedContext`
holds it once and shares it across rates.

Compression is only part of the story: every attention layer also reads a local sliding window of
the most recent tokens directly, and the compressed entries are how it reaches anything older.
That window needs a causal sliding-window mask applied per document, `attention_mask`, and every
rotation in the block needs `position_ids` together with the RoPE tables evaluated at them,
`position_embeddings`. None of those belongs to any single compress rate.

`PackedContext.build` takes `seq_lens` and derives every one of its fields from it. Nothing else is
an input, so a position that disagrees with a document boundary, a mask that spans one, or a RoPE
table evaluated at positions other than the ones the causal thresholds count in, cannot be
constructed. It runs once per model forward, since none of this depends on depth.
