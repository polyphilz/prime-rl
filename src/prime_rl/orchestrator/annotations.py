"""What the orchestrator knows about an episode, recorded as it learns it.

An episode is serialized once, when it arrives, so a trace's later facts cannot be
implied by where its record sits. Both events below are stamped explicitly: what the
orchestrator knows at arrival goes onto the trace before it is logged, and what a batch
adds when it takes the episode becomes an append-only update the reader folds back on.
