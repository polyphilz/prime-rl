"""Orchestrator-side algorithm runtime.

The config side (``prime_rl.configs.algorithm``) defines *what* an algorithm
is — a bundle of sampling and the per-token training signal. This package
turns the signal half into runtime objects (the sampling half is the env's
:class:`~prime_rl.orchestrator.generation_source.GenerationSource`):

- one module per algorithm (``grpo``, ``qorl_anchored_grpo``, ``echo``,
  ``max_rl``, ``rae``, ``hierarchical_grpo``, ``opd``, ``opsd``, ``sft``) — each named class owns
  its scoring hooks
  (``score_episode`` / ``score_group``) and declares what it needs (loss
  component, a "teacher", ...). One instance per env, built by
  :func:`build_algorithm`. A new credit-assignment scheme is a new named class:
  subclass :class:`Algorithm`, assign advantages in the hook whose timing fits,
  and register it below.
- ``base`` — the :class:`Algorithm` base class. Algorithms annotate native
  verifier graphs; transport samples are compiled only after admission.
- ``routing`` — graph annotation and final transport loss routing.
